    <h1>Privacy Policy for AI Camera</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

    <p>
      AI Camera does not collect personal data from users of the mobile
      application. The app is intended for authorized school staff only. Login
      credentials are issued manually by school administrators and are not tied
      to personal accounts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app displays security alerts generated by an external school
      monitoring system. These alerts may include event metadata (such as time
      and alert type), but do not contain personal student information within
      the app interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      The application does not use analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking
      tools. The app does not create or store user profiles. No personal
      identifiers are transmitted to third parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any data processed within the app exists solely for operational school
      safety purposes and cannot be used to identify individual users or
      students.
    </p>

    <p>
      If future updates introduce features such as cloud accounts, usage
      analytics, or additional data processing, this Privacy Policy will be
      updated in advance.
    </p>
